This is a cross-platform library written in C++ which allows developers to read many of the critical file types used by Neverwinter Nights 1.69 / 1.74. It compiles and runs on Windows and Linux on x86 processors. There will probably be issues on ARM processors.

Requirements: A compliant C++17 compiler is required. For Windows, this is Visual Studio Preview 1 or newer. I use GCC 7.2 on Linux but an older version may or may not work.

Check the examples folder to see how the library is used.

The supported file types are:

- GFF (bic, itp, etc)
- ERF (hak, mod, sav, etc)
- KEY
- BIF
- TLK

The library is completely free for anyone to copy, use, and change with or without attribution.
