This is a cross-platform library written in C++ which allows developers to read many of the critical file types used by Neverwinter Nights 1.69 / 1.74. It compiles and runs on Windows and Linux on x86 processors. There will probably be issues on ARM processors.

Check the examples folder to see how the library is used.

The supported file types are:

- GFF (bic, itp, etc)
- ERF (hak, mod, sav, etc)
- KEY
- BIF

The library is completely free for anyone to copy, use, and change with or without attribution.
